# Peer Audit Report (Your Agent's Output)

This directory will contain the Markdown audit report your Automaton Auditor generates when run against your assigned **peer's** Week 2 repository.

Run the agent with your peer's repo URL:
```powershell
uv run python src/graph.py --repo-url <peer-repo-url> --pdf-path <peer-report.pdf>
```
The output `report.md` will be saved here automatically.
