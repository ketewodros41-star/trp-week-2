## Criterion Breakdown

### Git Forensic Analysis (Score: 1/5)

Defense (Score: 1/5): The defense's analysis was interrupted. We maintain that the architectural intent remains sound despite this telemetry failure.
- Evidence cited: E1

Prosecutor (Score: 1/5): The prosecution's analysis tool failed. In the absence of proof, I assume maximum structural risk and lazy engineering. Evaluation blocked by technical error.
- Evidence cited: E1

TechLead (Score: 1/5): Internal monitoring failed for this dimension. Operationally, this is a 'unknown-unknown' risk. Defaulting to safe baseline.
- Evidence cited: E1

## Final Remediation Plan

Priority remediation by file:
- `README.md`: Git Forensic Analysis (score 1/5)
Execution order:
1. Fix security/tooling and structured output reliability first.
2. Improve synthesis dissent quality and criterion-level actionability.
3. Tighten documentation-to-code cross-reference coverage.
