Use AST parsing (not regex) to find classes inheriting from 'BaseModel' (Pydantic) or 'TypedDict'. Verify that the state actively maintains a collection of 'Evidence' objects and a list of 'JudicialOpinion' objects. Check for the use of 'operator.add' and 'operator.ior' as state reducers in 'Annotated' type hints to prevent data overwriting during parallel execution. Capture the full code snippet of the core 'AgentState' definition.",
      "success_pattern": "'AgentState' uses TypedDict or BaseModel with Annotated reducers. 'Evidence' and 'JudicialOpinion' are Pydantic BaseModel classes with typed fields. Reducers like 'operator.add' (for lists) and 'operator.ior' (for dicts) are present.",

Determine if the Detectives (RepoInvestigator, DocAnalyst, VisionInspector) branch out from a single node and run concurrently (fan-out). Verify there is a synchronization node ('EvidenceAggregator' or equivalent) that collects all evidence before the Judges are invoked (fan-in). Verify the Judges (Prosecutor, Defense, TechLead) also fan-out in parallel from the aggregation node and fan-in before the ChiefJustice.
